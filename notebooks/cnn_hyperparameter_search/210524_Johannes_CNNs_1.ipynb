    "# Topic: EX2 - Turbofan RUL Prediction\n",
    "**Task**: Predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan engines based on given sensor data (time series data). It is a forcasting problem, where the goal is to predict the number of cycles an engine will last before it fails.\n",
    "**Data**: Turbofan engine degradation simulation data (NASA) - [Link](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/Turbofan-Engine-Degradation-Simulation-Data-Set/vrks-gjie). See also in the topic [introduction notebook](https://github.com/nina-prog/damage-propagation-modeling/blob/2fb8c1a1102a48d7abbf04e4031807790a913a99/notebooks/Turbofan%20remaining%20useful%20life%20Prediction.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subtasks**:\n",
    "1. Perform a deep **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the given data.\n",
    "2. Implement a more efficient **sliding window method** for time series data analysis. -> 🎯 **Focus on this task**\n",
    "3. Apply **traditional machine learning methods** (SOTA) to predict the remaining useful life. Includes data preparation, feature extraction, feature selection, model selection, and model parameter optimization.\n",
    "4. Create **neural network models** to predict the remaining useful life. Includes different architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Attention Models. Note: You can search for SOTA research papers and reproduce current state-of-the-art models.\n"
